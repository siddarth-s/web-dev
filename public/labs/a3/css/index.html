<h2>Style attribute and tag</h2>

<h3>Style attribute</h3>
<p style="background-color: blue; color: white">
    Style attribute allows configuring look and feel
    right on the element. Although it's very convenient
    it is considered bad practice and you should avoid
    using the style attribute
</p>

<h3>Style tag</h3>
<p>A slightly better way to configure look and feel
    is to declare CSS rules in the STYLE tag in the
    header and then refer to the tag by their name, ID,
    or class This paragraph's style is set by a rule
    referring to the P tags
</p>

<h2>Selectors</h2>
<h3>Link tag</h3>
<p>
    The best way to apply CSS rules is to declare them
    in a separate CSS file and load it with the LINK tag.
    Always use this method.</p>
