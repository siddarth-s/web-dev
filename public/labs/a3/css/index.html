<h1>Cascading Style Sheet (CSS)</h1>
<h2>Style attribute and tag</h2>

<h3>Style attribute</h3>
<p style="background-color: blue; color: white">
    Style attribute allows configuring look and feel
    right on the element. Although it's very convenient
    it is considered bad practice and you should avoid
    using the style attribute
</p>

<h3>Style tag</h3>
<p>A slightly better way to configure look and feel
    is to declare CSS rules in the STYLE tag in the
    header and then refer to the tag by their name, ID,
    or class This paragraph's style is set by a rule
    referring to the P tags
</p>

<h2>Selectors</h2>
<h3>Link tag</h3>
<p>
    The best way to apply CSS rules is to declare them
    in a separate CSS file and load it with the LINK tag.
    Always use this method.</p>

<h3>ID selectors</h3>
<p id="id-selector-1">
    Instead of changing the look and
    feel of all the elements of the same
    name, e.g., P, we can refer to a
    specific element by its ID
</p>
<p id="id-selector-2">
    Here's another paragraph using a
    different ID and a different look and
    feel</p>

<h3>Class selectors</h3>
<p class="class-selector">
    Instead of using IDs to refer to
    elements, you can use an
    element's CLASS attribute</p>
<h4 class="class-selector">
    This heading has same style as
    paragraph above</h4>

<div class="selector-1">
    <h3>Document structure selectors</h3>
    <div class="selector-2">
        Selectors can be combined to refer elements in
        particular places in the document
        <p class="selector-3">
            This paragraph's red background is referenced as
            <br/>.selector-2 .selector3<br/>
            meaning the descendant of some ancestor.
            <br/>
            <span class="selector-4">Whereas this span is a
direct child of its parent</span>
            <br/>
            You can combine these relationships to create
            specific styles depending on the document structure
